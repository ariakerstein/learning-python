## Python learning materials


### Installing Python/Anaconda

We will use Python 3, installed with Anaconda. To get that on your laptop:

- Download this file: http://repo.continuum.io/anaconda3/Anaconda3-2.1.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
   You want the `.sh`, *not* the `.pkg` file. Believe me.
   
- In the shell, switch your working directory to the one containing this file
  (typically `~/Downloads`) and run:

    sh Anaconda3-2.1.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

You will be asked to press `ENTER` to continue, which will drop you into a
buffer containing the license. Type `q` to exit that buffer, and then enter
`yes` to continue. The proposed installation location that should then appear
should be something like: `/Users/arokem/anaconda3`. Accept that, and wait for
the installation to complete.

Anaconda should give you the basic tools for scientific computing, including
`ipython`/`numpy`/`scipy`/`matplotlib` and many more. 

### Topics:

- A whirlwind tour through basic python.

    For this, we will use the ipython notebook. To fire up a notebook, change your work

- Testing with [`nosetest`](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

- Modules and packages

- Object oriented programming in Python

- Scientific Python: []

- Useful additional libraries
